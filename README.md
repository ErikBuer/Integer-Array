# Integer-Array
No-STD numeric fixed-size array for Rust.

This is an experimental library for no-std DSP.
The library only supports fixed-sized arrays of i32.
32-bit arrays can be handled by most DSP-capable embedded devices and provides 6.02Ã—32>192 dB of dynamic range, which is sufficient for most DSP use.
The rationale is that if 64-bit processing is available, then so is an OS, and the Rust standard library. 

The package can be found at https://crates.io/crates/integer_array.
